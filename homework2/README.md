This project uses a 2SLS model to provide a causal estimate of the impact of education on wages. This is a copy of the methods of Card (1995). The 2SLS model is estimated "manually" in Python, but I also used to AER package in R to get correctly adjusted standard errors.

Also included is a demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers using a 6-sided dice roll.
